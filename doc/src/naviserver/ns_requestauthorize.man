[titledesc {Perform authorization check}]

[description]

This function does the same permission check that the NaviServer does before serving
a URL. If the nsperm module is loaded, the algorithm is as follows. See Chapter 6 in
the Naviserver Administrator's Guide for information on access control, including permissions.

[list_begin itemized]

[item] If the authuser is "nsadmin", the password is correct, and the IP
          address of the client is allowed nsadmin access, then access is authorized.

[item] Find the relevant permission record. If an exact match for the method and URL
         combination is not found, the end of the URL is pared down until a match is found.
         For example, if there is no match for `/products/cereals/raisin_bran.html,' then
         the server looks for a permission record for the URL `/products/cereals.' If that
         permission record is specified as "Exact URL match is NOT required", then that
          permission record is used.
[list_end]

[para]
By default, the server comes with a row that says GET on `/' is open to the world.

[para]
If no relevant permission record is found, access is denied (forbidden).

[list_begin itemized]

[item] If the authuser is in the "Allow Users" list, access is permitted. If the authuser
         is a member of a group in the "Allow Groups" list and not in the "Deny Users' list,
          access is permitted.

[item] If the host is in the "Hosts to allow" list, access is permitted. If the host
         is in the "Hosts to deny" list, access is denied.

[item] If the request does not come in with authorization data, access is denied.

[item] The user and password are verified. If there is no password specified in the database,
         any password is accepted.

[item]  Otherwise, access is denied.

[list_end]

[section {RETURN VALUES}]

The following values can be returned by ns_requestauthorize.

[list_begin itemized]

[item] OK The user has permission to execute this URL and method.
[item] DENIED The user does not have permission to execute this URL and method.
[item] FORBIDDEN There is no possible user/password/IP Address combination that would give authorization.
[item] ERROR There was an error.

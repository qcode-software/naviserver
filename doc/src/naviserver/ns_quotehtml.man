[titledesc {Escape HTML characters so they appear as-is in HTML pages}]

[description]

Returns the contents of html with certain characters that are special in HTML
replaced with an escape code.  This allows text displayed in a webpage that
might otherwise be interpreted as containing HTML markup instructions to be
interpreted as literal characters to be displayed.  Specifically:

[list_begin definitions]
[def] & becomes &amp;
[def] < becomes &lt;
[def] > becomes &gt;
[def] ' becomes &#39;
[def] " becomes &#34;
[list_end]

 All other characters are unmodified in the output.

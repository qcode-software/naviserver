[titledesc {Execute a command after a time delay}]

[description]

 This command executes a script in the background after a number of seconds time delay.
 It does this by scheduling a one-shot event in the scheduler.  Uncaught script errors will
 go to the server log.  It returns an ID which can be used to unschedule the execution
 of the script (if seconds hasn't elapsed) using ns_unschedule_proc.

[para]
 The script when executed will run in the scheduler thread.  If the script is long-running,
 this may interfere with the execution of other scheduled scripts, in which
 case ns_schedule_proc should be used instead of ns_after.

[titledesc {Make a unique temporary file name}]

[description]

This command is a wrapper around the mktemp(3) function in the C standard library. 
It takes a template, which is a string whose last six characters must be XXXXXX, 
and returns a new string where those are replaced with random characters such as 
to make the string a unique file name. It is commonly used to safely create temporary files.

[para]
Note that some implementations of mktemp are not so safe - it creates
predictable/only a small number of variations - please consult your 
system's man pages if this might be an issue to you. NaviServer could
potentially be improved to use mkstemp instead.

[description]

This command generates a cryptographically secure random number. 
If maximum is not specified, the random number returned is a 
floating-point value n such that 0.0 &lt;= n &lt; 1.0.  If maximum
is specified, it must be a positive integer between 1 and 2147483647,
in which case ns_rand will return an integer value n such that 0 <= n <= max - 1.

Internally ns_rand is implemented with the drand48() and lrand48() standard
library functions.  An internal random seed is generated the first time 
ns_rand is called after the server starts.

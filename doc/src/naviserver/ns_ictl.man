[description]

These commands provides a mechanism to control Tcl interpreter initialisation,
cleanup, lifetime, synchronization etc.



[section {COMMANDS}]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ns_cleanup] ]

Cleanup the interpreter. this function is used to close all currently
open files, to destroy the global variables, destroy the (volatile)
ns_sets, to abort http requests and to call other cleanup callbacks.
The function is called typically internally, eg. at the end of a
connection thread.


[call [cmd ns_reinit] ]

Cleanup and initialise the interpreter. This is used for long running detached
threads to avoid resource leaks and/or missed state changes.

[example_begin]
ns_thread begin {
    while {1} {
        ns_reinit
        # ... long running work ...
    }
}
[example_end]



[call [cmd ns_eval] \
	 [opt [option -sync]] \
	 [opt [option -pending]] \
	 [arg script] \
	 [opt [arg args]] ]

Evaluate the given script and args and arrange for it's side effects to
propagate to all interpreters in all threads for the current virtual server. Use
this to define new procs once the server has started.

[para]
If the script evaluates without error then it is appended to the interpreter
intialisation script. Other threads will begin to pick up the changes when
they next run their [term delete] traces and notice that the [term epoch] has
changed.

[para]
If the [option -sync] option is given then [cmd ns_eval] will return only
after the interpreter initialisation script has been updated. Otherwise, there
might be a small delay before the initialisation script receives the update
due to [cmd ns_eval] [arg script]'s being evaluated in series.

[para]
If the [option -pending] option is given a list of all scripts which are queued
to be folded into the inerpreter initialisation script are returned.



[call [cmd "ns_ictl trace"] [arg tracewhen] [arg script] [opt [arg args]] ]

Register an interpreter [term trace] [arg script].

[para]
[option create], [option allocate] and [option getconn] traces are called in FIFO (first
in, first out) order; [option freeconn], [option deallocate] and [option delete] traces
are called in LIFO (last in, first out) order.

[para]
All traces must be registered before server start up completes.  Valid
[option tracewhen] options are:

[list_begin options]

[opt_def create]
Create traces fires when a new interpreter is first created. They are the first
to be called, and are always called for every interpreter.

[opt_def allocate]
Allocate interpreter traces fire when an interpreter is first allocated for a
particular thread, for example at the beginning of connection processing, job
queue processing, or for a scheduled procedure.

[opt_def getconn]
Getconn interpreter traces fire after all allocate traces have run, before
connection processing for a URL begins.

[para]
Note: a [option getconn] interpreter trace fires only once per connection, so if a
Tcl proc is registered as a connection filter, that will trigger the
[option getconn] interpreter trace, otherwise it will fire later in the process
when the registered proc, [term ADP], or Tcl page runs.

[opt_def freeconn]
Freeconn interpreter traces fire after connection processing is complete, before
any deallocate interpreter traces.

[opt_def deallocate]
Deallocate interpreter traces fire at the end of a transaction, after any
[term getconn] traces if running in a connection thread.

[para]
A deallocate trace is a good place for general resource cleanup.

[opt_def delete]
Delete interpreter traces fire when an interpreter is deleted. Interpreters are
often cached per-thread and reused multiple times, so a [opt delete] trace
may only fire when a thread exits or when [cmd "ns_ictl markfordelete"] is
called explicitly. They are the last trace to be called for an interp, and are
always called, eventually.

[list_end]



[call [cmd "ns_ictl markfordelete"] ]

Mark the interpreter for deletion after the [term deallocate] interpreter traces
and have run. This is useful when it's necessary to delete an interp after it
has been modified in a way that cannot be safely cleaned up, such as by the
TclPro debugger.



[call [cmd "ns_ictl addmodule"] [arg modulename] ]

Add a module to the list of modules to be initialised for the current virtual
server and return the whole list.  The modules are loaded later.



[call [cmd "ns_ictl getmodules"] ]

Return the list of modules to be loaded for the current virtual server.



[call [cmd "ns_ictl get"] ]

Return the interpreter initialisation script for the current virtual
server.



[call [cmd "ns_ictl epoch"] ]

Return the epoch (version) of the interpreter initialization script for the
current virtual server.

The epoch increases by 1 whenever [cmd "ns_ictl save"] is called, such as by
[cmd ns_eval].



[call [cmd "ns_ictl save"] [arg script] ]

Replace the interpreter initialization script for the current virtual
server.

The newly saved script will be used to initialise newly created
interpreters. Existing interpreters will be be reinitialised when
[cmd "ns_ictl update"] is called.



[call [cmd "ns_ictl update"] ]

Re-run the interpreter initialisation script if it has changed since this
interpreter was last initialised.

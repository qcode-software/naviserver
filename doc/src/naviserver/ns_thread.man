[description]

This command provides a mechanism to manipulate threads.  The legal options (which may be abbreviated) are:

[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]


[call [cmd ns_thread] [opt [arg {arg arg ...}]]]


[list_end]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg begin] [arg script]]
[def] ns_thread create script

Initializes a new thread and starts it executing script.  Threads created this way
are joinable and must be ns_thread joined, otherwise the resources held by the thread
will not be freed until the thread is joined.  Returns a handle to the new thread.

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg begindetached] [arg script]]

Initializes a new thread and starts it executing script.  Threads created this way
are detached and do not need to be (nor can be) joined.

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg get]]

Returns the handle for the current thread.

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg getid]]

Returns the current thread's thread ID as an integer.  This thread ID corresponds
to the third element in the sub-list returned from ns_info threads.

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg name] [opt [arg name]]]

Returns the name of the current thread.  Optionally sets the thread name if name is specified.

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg join] [arg tid]]

Attempts to join the thread specified by thread handle tid.  If the thread is still executing,
the caller will block until the thread being joined completes.  Returns the return value of
the script that the thread being joined was executing.

NOTE: Attempting to join a thread that has already been joined will
currently crash the server.

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg stackinfo]]

Returns the maximum available size of the C stack and the currently free size of the
C stack from the current thread in a form usable for "array set".  For
example the command might return "max 2048000 free 2024408"

[call [cmd  ns_thread] [arg yield]]

Causes the current thread to yield its CPU to other running threads.

[list_end]

[para]
Calling ns_thread join on an invalid thread ID or a thread ID that has
already been joined will cause the server to abort with a fatal error.  See

[titledesc {Scheduling Tcl scripts}]

[description]

These commands perform scheduling of Tcl scripts at various intervals. Script will run in
separate thread as background procedures. This functionality is similar to Unix cron.

[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]


[call [cmd ns_schedule_proc] [opt [option {-once}]] [opt [option -thread]] [arg interval] [arg script]]

This command schedules a script to be run after a certain number of seconds.
Returns the ID of the newly scheduled script.  If [option -once] is specified, then the
script is run once and then unscheduled, otherwise it will continue to run every
interval seconds.  If [option -thread] is specified, then the script will be run in its
own thread, otherwise it will run in the scheduler's thread.  If the script is
long-running, this may interfere with the running of other scheduled scripts,
so long-running scripts should be run in their own threads.

[example_begin]
   % set id [lb][lb]ns_schedule_proc -once 60 { ns_log notice "this should run in 60 seconds" }[rb][rb]
   123
[example_end]



[call [cmd ns_schedule_weekly] [opt [option -once]] [opt [option -thread]] [arg day] [arg hour] [arg minute] [arg script]]

This command schedules a script to be run on a certain day of the week at a
certain hour and minute of that day.  Returns the ID of the newly scheduled script.
The week starts on Sunday as day zero and runs to Saturday as day six.
If [option -once] is
specified, then the script is run once and then unscheduled, otherwise it will continue
to run every week on that day at that time.  If [option -thread]
is specified, then the script
will be run in its own thread, otherwise it will run in the scheduler's thread.  If
the script is long-running, this may interfere with the running of other scheduled
scripts, so long-running scripts should be run in their own threads.

NOTE: day, hour and minute are specified in local time.  Beware of Daylight Savings Time
shifts affecting the time of day when the script will execute.

[example_begin]
   % set id [lb][lb]ns_schedule_weekly -once 2 5 35 { ns_log notice "It is now Tuesday at 5:35 AM." }[rb][rb]
   123
[example_end]

[example_begin]
   % ns_unschedule_proc $id
[example_end]


[call [cmd ns_schedule_daily] [opt [option -once]] [opt [option -thread]] [arg hour] [arg minute] [arg script]]

This command schedules a script to be run at a certain hour and minute of the day.
Returns the ID of the newly scheduled script.  If [option -once] is specified, then the script
is run once and then unscheduled, otherwise it will continue to run every day at that
time.  If [option -thread] is specified, then the script will be run in its own thread,
otherwise it will run in the scheduler's thread.  If the script is long-running,
this may interfere with the running of other scheduled scripts, so long-running scripts should
be run in their own threads.

NOTE: hour and minute are specified in local time.  Beware of Daylight Savings Time
shifts affecting the time of day when the script will execute.

[example_begin]
   % set id [lb][lb]ns_schedule_daily -once 5 35 { ns_log notice "It is now 5:35 AM." }[rb][rb]
   123
[example_end]

[example_begin]
   % ns_unschedule_proc $id
[example_end]




[call [cmd ns_pause] [arg id]]

Pause a scheduled script from running. This command pauses a scheduled
script from running at its next scheduled time.  Returns 1 on success,
0 on failure.

[example_begin]
   % set id [lb][lb]ns_schedule_daily 1 0 { ns_log notice "One AM and all is well.  *gong*" }[rb][rb]
   19
   
   % ns_pause $id
   1
[example_end]

[call [cmd ns_resume] [arg id]]

Resume a previously paused scheduled script. This command resumes
scheduling of a previously paused script via [cmd ns_pause].  Returns 1
on success, 0 on failure.

[example_begin]
   % set id [lb][lb]ns_schedule_daily 1 0 { ns_log notice "One AM and all is well.  *gong*" }[rb][rb]
   19
   
   % ns_pause $id
   1
   
   % ns_resume $id
   1
[example_end]


[call [cmd ns_after] [arg seconds] [arg script]]

Execute a command after a time delay. 
 This command executes a script in the background after a number of seconds time delay.
 It does this by scheduling a one-shot event in the scheduler.  Uncaught script errors will
 go to the server log.  It returns an ID which can be used to unschedule the execution
 of the script (if seconds hasn't elapsed) using [cmd ns_unschedule_proc].

[para]
 The script when executed will run in the scheduler thread.  If the script is long-running,
 this may interfere with the execution of other scheduled scripts, in which
 case [cmd ns_schedule_proc] should be used instead of ns_after.

[example_begin]
   % ns_after 5 { ns_log notice "ns_after script executed" }
   123
[example_end]



[call [cmd ns_unschedule_proc] [arg id]]
Unschedules a  previous  scheduled  script.

[para]
NOTE: Current  behavior  is  to silently return without error if the id
doesn't represent a currently scheduled ID.

[example_begin]
   % ns_unschedule_proc $id
[example_end]

[list_end]

[section {Logging}]


When entries are written from scheduled procedures to the server log
via [cmd ns_log] these entries can be identified by the string
[example_begin]
...[lb]-sched:THREAD_NR:COUNTER_IN_THREAD:SCHED_ID-[rb]...
[example_end]
where THREAD_NR refers to the nth thread, COUNTER_IN_THREAD is the nth
job in this thread and the SCHED_ID refers to the ID of the scheduled
script as returned by the ns_schedule* commands.

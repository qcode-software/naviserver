[titledesc {Create a symbolic link}]

[description]

This command creates a symbolic link named filename2 that points to the file or
directory specified by filename1.  If the link fails, a Tcl error is generated,
unless -nocomplain is specified.

This is a legacy command from when Tcl did not have this functionality. 
It is now recommended you use Tcl's file link command instead.

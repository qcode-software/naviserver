[titledesc {Parse an ADP file or string and return its output}]

[description]

This function processes the specified ADP file or string and returns
the result as a string. Processing a second ADP from inside an ADP
is normally best done with ns_adp_include as that command
resolves relative pathnames passed to it.  Also note that
ns_adp_parse will ignore any directives to turn on streaming.
Tcl_Eval is used to evaluate the Tcl commands in the ADP.

[para]
Although the <% ... %> syntax is allowed in the string,
if you have this embedded in an ADP, you have to be careful in
constructing the string that you do not prematurely terminate an
enclosing script.

[para]
The -file file option can be used to parse ADP contained in
the given file.  This use is similar to that of ns_adp_include
except the result is returned by the command instead of automatically
being appended to the output stream.

[para]
-tcl flags can be passed to tell that given file is .tcl file which should 
be appropriately wrapped and parsed.

[para]
The -global and -local options are deprecated and ignored. All calls
are now local to the current ADP call frame.

[para]
Additional arguments are passed to the ADP execution and can be
accessed via the ns_adp_argc, ns_adp_argv, and
ns_adp_bind_args commands.

[para]
You can pass optional arguments to the ADP.  The arguments can be accessed within the
ADP using the ns_adp_argc, ns_adp_argv and ns_adp_bind_args commands.

[para]
If this call is a nested ADP evaluation (where one ADP calls another), an error will
be thrown if the depth exceeds 256, the maximum number of nested ADP evaluations.

[titledesc {Operate on semaphore-like objects}]

[description]

This command provides a mechanism to manipulate semaphore-like objects
but are not inter-process capable like true semaphores.  They are actually
implemented with a mutex and a counter.  The legal options (which may be abbreviated) are:


[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]


 [call [cmd ns_sema] [opt [arg {arg arg ...}]]]


[list_end]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd  ns_sema] [arg create] [opt [arg count]]]

Initializes a new semaphore whose count is initialized to zero by default
or count otherwise.  Returns a handle to the semaphore object.

[call [cmd  ns_sema] [arg destroy] [arg object]]

Destroys the semaphore object and frees any resources it was using.

[call [cmd  ns_sema] [arg release] [arg object] [opt [arg count]]]

Releases the semaphore object by incrementing the counter by one by default
or by count otherwise.  The thread will wake any threads blocking on this 
semaphore when count is equal to one.

This is what is commonly referred to as "semaphore up".

[call [cmd  ns_sema] [arg wait] [arg object]]

Waits for a semaphore object to be greater than zero.  Will block the thread until
this is true.  Decrements the counter by one when the counter is greater than zero.

This is what is commonly referred to as "semaphore down".

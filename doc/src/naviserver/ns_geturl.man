[description]
This function retrieves the contents of the passed-in URL. If headersSetIdVar is passed in 
and it is a valid ns_set, then the header information received along with the request is 
inserted into it.

[para]
Notes: This function should be used with caution. If the server is running with 1 thread, 
and you perform ns_geturl back to the originating server, the server may deadlock.

Also, ns_geturl does not follow redirects or handle relative URLs. URLs that are server-relative 
(begin with "/") are translated into filenames, and the content of the file is returned.

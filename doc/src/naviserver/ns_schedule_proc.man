[titledesc {Schedule a script to run after a certain number of seconds}]

[description]

This command schedules a script to be run after a certain number of seconds.
Returns the ID of the newly scheduled script.  If -once is specified, then the
script is run once and then unscheduled, otherwise it will continue to run every
interval seconds.  If -thread is specified, then the script will be run in its
own thread, otherwise it will run in the scheduler's thread.  If the script is
long-running, this may interfere with the running of other scheduled scripts,
so long-running scripts should be run in their own threads.

[para]
ns_unschedule_proc command unschedules a  previous  scheduled  script.   NOTE:
Current  behavior  is  to silently return without error if the id
doesn't represent a currently scheduled ID.

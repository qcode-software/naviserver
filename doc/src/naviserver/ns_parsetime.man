[description]

This command takes a nine-element Tcl list as time representing the Unix struct 
tm structure (as would be returned from ns_gmtime or ns_localtime) and based on 
option, returns an element from the list.  The valid options are: sec, min, hour,
mday, mon, year, wday, yday, isdst.  The options are listed in order of the actual
elements in the Tcl list itself.

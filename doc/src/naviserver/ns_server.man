Query or set the maximum number of connection threads for this server
and pool. The value must be large than [arg minthreads] and less than

	[opt [option "-pool [arg p]"]] \
	[arg stats]]

Returns a list of attribute value pairs containing statistics for the
server and pool, containing the number of requests, queued requests,
cumulative times.

[call [cmd  ns_server] \

[description]

This command provides a simple HTTP client mechanism.

[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd "ns_http cancel"] \
	[arg id]]

Cancel queued http request by id (ns_set id of request).

[call [cmd "ns_http cleanup"]]

Cancel all pending http requests

[call [cmd "ns_http list"]]

Return the list of currently running or pending requests in format:
id url done|running ....

[call [cmd "ns_http queue"] \
	[opt [arg {-method M}]] \
	[opt [arg {-headers S}]] \
	[opt [arg {-body B}]] \
	[opt [arg {-timeout T}]] \
	[arg url] \
	]

[arg -method]
use the specified HTTP method such as GET or POST or HEAD

[para]
[arg -headers]
headers is the ns_set ID containing the additional headers to include in the HTTP request.

[para]
[arg -body]
body is the value which will be sent as the HTTP request body.

[para]
[arg -timeout]
Timeout for how long to wait for finishing the request (default
2:0, secs:microsesc)

[para]
The command [cmd "ns_http queue"] opens a connection to the web server
denoted in the [arg url] and returns on success the [arg id] of the HTTP
request, which might be used later in a [cmd "ns_http wait"] 
or [cmd "ns_http cancel"] command to refer to this request.


[call [cmd "ns_http run"] \
	[opt [arg {-method M}]] \
	[opt [arg {-headers S}]] \
	[opt [arg {-body B}]] \
	[opt [arg {-timeout T}]] \
	[arg url] \
	]

[para] 
Send a HTTP reuqest and wait for the result.  The command 
[cmd "ns_http run"] is similar to [cmd "ns_http queue"] followed by 
[cmd "ns_http wait"].


[call [cmd "ns_http wait"] \
	[opt [arg {-elapsed varName}]] \
	[opt [arg {-file varName}]] \
	[opt [arg {-headers H}]] \
	[opt [arg {-result varName}]] \
	[opt [arg {-spoolsize int}]] \
	[opt [arg {-status varName}]] \
	[opt [arg {-timeout t}]] \
	[arg id]]

[para]
[arg -elapsed]
varName is the name of a variable that should be used to store the elapsed
time for the request from beginning to finish

[para]
[arg -file]
varName is the name of a variable that will contain the name of the 
temporary file in case the request was larger than [arg -spoolsize]

[para]
[arg -headers]
headers is the ns_set ID which will receive the headers from the HTTP response.

[para]
[arg -result]
varName is the name of a variable that should be used to store the HTTP response body.

[para]
[arg -spoolsize]
In case the result is larger than spoolsize, it will be spooled to a
temporary file returned in the variable denoted by [arg -file].

[para]
[arg -status]
varName is the name of a variable that should be used to store the HTTP response status

[para]
[arg -timeout]
Optional additional timeout for the wait command. Might be governed by
the timeout specified in the queue subcommand.

[para]
[arg id]
ns_set ID of the HTTP request to wait for.

[para]
The command [cmd "ns_http wait"] specifies, how the results of request
should be delivered and what information should be obtained from the
request in which form. The command waits until the request is
finished. For retrieving large content (e.g. .mp4 files) from a
server, it is recommended to use the [arg -spoolsize] option,
since per default the results are received into memory.

[section EXAMPLES]

First, a minimal example:
[example_begin]
 % ns_http queue http://www.google.com
 http0
 % ns_http wait -status S -result R http0
 1
[example_end]

The second example set a larger timeout on the request, provides
query-headers and returns reply-headers, and spools results to a file,
when the result is larger than 100 bytes.

[example_begin]
 set queryHeaders [lb]ns_set create[rb]
 set replyHeaders [lb]ns_set create[rb]
 ns_set update $queryHeaders Host localhost
 
 set h [lb]ns_http queue -headers $queryHeaders -timeout 10:0 http://www.google.com[rb]
 ns_http wait -result R -headers $replyHeaders -status S -spoolsize 1000 -file F $h
 
 if {[lb]info exists F[rb]} {
   ns_log notice "Spooled [lb]file size $F[rb] bytes to $F"
   file delete $F
 } else {
   ns_log notice "Got [lb]string length $R[rb] bytes"
 }
[example_end]

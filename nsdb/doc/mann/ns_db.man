[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd "ns_db bindrow"] [arg handle]]

ns_db bindrow returns an ns_set structure whose key names are the column names
of the rows returned by the SQL command previously-executed with ns_db exec.
If the database is not currently returning rows (i.e., a status other than
NS_ROWS was returned by ns_db exec), an error is thrown. The handle argument is
a database handle (obtained with ns_db gethandle).



[call [cmd "ns_db bouncepool"] [arg poolname]]

Marks all database handles for the specified database pool as stale. When any
database handle currently open is put back into the pool, its connection to the
database will be reset.



[call [cmd "ns_db cancel"] [arg handle]]

ns_db cancel cancels the current operation.



[call [cmd "ns_db close"] [arg handle]]

Closes the connection. Use this function only on handles that were obtained by
the ns_db open function. The server automatically close handles when the
operation is complete, so you don't normally have to call this function.



[call [cmd "ns_db connected"] [arg handle]]

ns_db connected returns a boolean value indicating whether the connection to the database pool is made.



[call [cmd "ns_db datasource"] [arg handle]]

Returns the datasource for the database pool.


[call [cmd "ns_db rowcount"] [arg handle]]

Returns number of processed records by the last SQL stetements, this is useful with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
statements to know how many records updated.



[call [cmd "ns_db dbtype"] [arg handle]]

Returns the database type for the database pool.



[call [cmd "ns_db  dml"] [arg handle] [arg sql]]

ns_db dml executes SQL that should be data manipulation language such as an
insert or update, or data definition language such as a create table.



[call [cmd "ns_db driver"] [arg handle]]

Returns the name of the driver of the handle.



[call [cmd "ns_db exception"] [arg handle]]

ns_db exception returns the most recent exception for the database pool.



[call [cmd "ns_db exec"] [arg handle] [arg sqlcommand]]

Executes the specified SQL command. It returns either NS_DML (if the SQL command
is a DML or DDL command) or NS_ROWS (if the SQL command returns rows, such as
a SELECT). This function can be used for ad hoc querying, where you don't know
what kind of SQL command will be executed.



[call [cmd "ns_db flush"] [arg handle]]

ns_db flush flushes the results of an SQL select so you do not need to use ns_db
getrow to get all the rows and throw them away.



[call [cmd "ns_db gethandle"] \
     [opt [option "-timeout [arg t]"]] \
     [arg poolname] \
     [opt [arg nhandles]] ]

ns_db gethandle returns the specified number of handles from the specified pool.
If poolname is not specified, the Defaultpool from the configuration file is
used. If nhandles is not specified, 1 handle is returned. (Note that if you
specify nhandles, you must also specify a poolname.) If not enough handles are
available to fulfill the request, it waits until they are available. You must
request all the handles you will need for a specific pool with one call to ns_db
gethandle. You must release all your database handles explicitly (with ns_db
releasehandle) before acquiring more. If you request multiple handles from the
database, this function returns a Tcl list of database handles (space
delimited). In this case, each handle must be released with a separate call to
ns_db releasehandle.

[para]
If [option -timeout] is not specified or timeout is zero, [cmd "ns_db gethandle"] will
wait indefinitely (perhaps forever) for the requested number of handles to
become available. If timeout is greater than zero, ns_db gethandle will either
return with the handles within that time period, or return "" if the time period
was exceeded, or generate a Tcl error. See the examples for [cmd "ns_db gethandle"], below.
The argument [arg t] can be specified in the form [arg sec[opt :microseconds]].

[call [cmd "ns_db getrow"] [arg handle] [arg setId]]

ns_db getrow fetches the next row waiting to be retrieved after an ns_db select.
The data is dumped right into the set associated with SETID, which should be the
set returned by the ns_db select. It returns "1" if there are more rows waiting
and returns "0" otherwise. If you call ns_db getrow again after already
receiving "0" on the previous call, an error is returned.



[call [cmd "ns_db open"] [arg driver] [arg datasource] [arg user] [arg password]]

ns_db open returns a handle at a lower level, circumventing the pools.



[call [cmd "ns_db poolname"] [arg handle]]

ns_db poolname returns the database pool that this handle came from.



[call [cmd "ns_db pools"]]

ns_db pools returns a list of all database pools.



[call [cmd "ns_db releasehandle"] [arg handle]]

Puts the handle back in the pool. The server will automatically return any open
handles to the pool after a page has finished executing.



[call [cmd "ns_db 1row"] [arg handle] [arg sql]]

This command expects the SQL to be a select statement that returns exactly one
row and returns that row as an ns_set. An error is returned if zero or more than
one row is returned.



[call [cmd "ns_db 0or1row"] [arg handle] [arg sql]]

This command expects the SQL to be a select statement that returns exactly zero
or one row. On zero rows, a null string is returned. On one row, a newly
allocated ns_set is returned. An error is thrown if more then one row
is returned.



[call [cmd "ns_db password"] [arg handle]]

Returns the password of the user for the database pool.



[call [cmd "ns_db select"] [arg handle] [arg sql]]

ns_db select executes the SQL statement on the database server. It returns an
ns_set with the keys set to the column names that were selected. Use ns_db
getrow to retrieve rows. You cannot perform nested select statements. Before you
start a new select statement, you must first either retrieve all the rows from
the first select or use the ns_db flush statement to flush any rows not
yet retrieved.



[call [cmd "ns_db setexception"] [arg handle] [arg code] [arg message]]

ns_db setexception returns the specified status code and message to the client.



[call [cmd "ns_db sp_exec"] [arg handle]]

ns_db sp_exec executes a stored procedure that has been initialized with ns_db
sp_start and ns_db sp_setparam. It returns "NS_DML" if the command was
succsesfully executed but did not return rows, or it returns "NS_ROWS" if the
command was successfully executed and did return rows (which can then be fetched
with ns_db bindrow and ns_db getrow). It throws an error if the command failed.
This function is implemented only for the Sybase database driver. See the
Examples section, below, for an example of this function.



[call [cmd "ns_db sp_getparams"]]

ns_db sp_getparams gets any output parameters set after executing a stored
procedure with ns_db sp_exec. It returns an ns_set or throws an error on failure.
This function is implemented only for the Sybase database driver. See the Examples
section, below, for an example of this function.



[call [cmd "ns_db sp_returncode"] [arg handle]]

ns_db sp_returncode gets the return code from a stored procedure. It must be
called after ns_db sp_exec. This function is implemented only for the Sybase
database driver. See the Examples section, below, for an example of
this function.



[call [cmd "ns_db sp_setparam"] \
     [arg handle] \
     [arg varname] \
     [arg vartype] \
     [arg inout] \
     [arg value] ]

ns_db sp_setparam sets a parameter for a call to a stored procedure. The varname
is the name of the variable, for example "@name". The vartype is the data type
of this parameter, for example "varchar". The inout argument indicates whether
it's an input or output parameter. It must be set to either "in" or "out".
The value is the paramter value to send. This function returns 1 on success and
throws an error on failure. This function is implemented only for the Sybase
database driver. See the Examples section, below, for an example of
this function.



[call [cmd "ns_db sp_start"] [arg handle] [arg procname]]

ns_db sp_start begins execution of the stored procedure called procname.
It returns 0 on success and throws an error on failure. This function is
implemented only for the Sybase database driver. See the Examples section,
below, for an example of this function.



[call [cmd "ns_db user"] [arg handle]]

Returns the user (as specified for the User parameter of the configuration file)
for the database pool.



[call [cmd "ns_db verbose"] [arg handle] [opt [arg enabled]]]

Change the verbose setting (the Verbose parameter in the configuration file) for
the given pool.

# procedure is:
#
#   CREATE PROCEDURE p_TestProc(@x int, @y varchar(16) out, @z int out)

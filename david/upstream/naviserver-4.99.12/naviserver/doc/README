# Things to remember when writing man pages
#

This README file is an initial attempt to provide a guideline on how to
structure and how to use the markup options of dtplite for the
naviserver documentation. It took me always quite a long time how to
figure one could or should to use dtplite so i starte writing this.
Judging from the different usage pattern in the documentation, i guess
others had similar problems. 

However this is just a first start and is aimed to provide
best-practice examples.

Structure:
==========

- Begin of man page
- [section COMMANDS]
- [section OPTIONS]
- [section EXAMPLES]
- [section CONFIGURATION]
- End of man page


Begin of a man page:
====================

[include version_include.man]

[manpage_begin ns_cache n [vset version]]
[moddesc   {NaviServer Built-In Commands}]
[titledesc {Cache manipulation}]

... general description ...

Sample definition of a command:
===============================

[call [cmd ns_xxxx] \
        [opt [option "-contents"]] \
        [opt [option "-reset"]] \
	[opt [option "-status [arg status]"]] \
        [opt [arg --]] \
        [arg name] ]

For subcommands use:
    [call [cmd  "ns_conn encoding"] [opt [arg encoding]]]
instead of 
    [call [cmd  ns_conn] [cmd encoding]] [opt [arg encoding]]]
since we might get a wrong (higlighted) rendering of "encoding".

References in the text:
=======================
the command .... receives optionally the option [option -content] ... 
and the argument [arg name] ...
Refer to a different command directly with [cmd ns_time] ...
the command xxxx return [term true] if the...
this is [emph important]
this is a URL [uri http://....]
this is a constant [const 10]

References between pages and "modules":
=======================================

Note that keywords work across "modules" (i.e. between "manual" and "naviserver"),
but see_also does not work here. One can man a see_also reference to a "keyword".
As a consequence, cross referenced sections need to have "keywords" entries.

[section OPTIONS]
====================

Describe common options used for several commands.

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -timeout [arg t]]
...
[opt_def -expires [arg t]]
...
[para]
.... The [option -expires] ...
[list_end]



End of the man page:
====================
- see_also: refer explicit to other commands or man pages
- keywords: links to other pages with the same keyword

Example:

[see_also ns_log ns_rollfile]
[keywords log path proxy ipaddress]

[manpage_end]

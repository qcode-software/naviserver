[titledesc {Set the value of the value attribute in an HTML element}]

[description]

This command takes a variable name to upvar, tagvar.  The variable should exist
in the calling environment and should contain an HTML element that has had its
closing ">" removed.  The string is searched for the attribute attribute, which
will be removed if found.  A value attribute will be added to the end of the string
with value value, which will be surrounded with double quotes.  This procedure does
not close the tag with a ">".

NOTES

I believe using "value" as the attribute name in the output instead of the passed in attribute may be a bug.

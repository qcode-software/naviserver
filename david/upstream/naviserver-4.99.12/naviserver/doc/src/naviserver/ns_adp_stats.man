[titledesc {Return statistics about cached ADP pages}]

[description]

 Returns statistics about ADP pages that have been cached.  The result is a list of lists, where
 each sublist contains 2 items: File, Statistics.  File is the complete path in the file system to
 a cached adp file, Statistics is a list containing statistics about that cached file in a
 format similar to Tcl's array get format.  Currently, the keys in Statistics are:

[example_begin]
   % foreach {file stats} <strong>ns_adp_stats</strong> {
         append output "\nFILE: ${file}\n"
         foreach {key value} $stats {

NOTES

 On the Windows platform, adp filenames are used as Hash table keys instead of dev and ino,
 so dev and ino will always be reported as 0 when running NaviServer on Windows.

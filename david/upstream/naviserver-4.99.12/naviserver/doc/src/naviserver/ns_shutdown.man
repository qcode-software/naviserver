[titledesc {Shut down NaviServer}]

[description]
This command shuts down the server.  If [emph timeout] is not specified
a default value (normally 20) is used; if it is specified, it should be
an integer >= 0.  The server will wait for up to the specified (or default)
number of seconds for existing connections to finish processing.  If this
time limit is exceeded then existing connections are immediately stopped.

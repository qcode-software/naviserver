[description]
ns_sockopen uses socket(), bind(), and connect() calls to connect to the
remote host (host) on the specified port (port). ns_sockopen returns a
list of two file ids: the first one for reads and the second one for writes.

[para]

The -nonblock option specifies that ns_sockopen will return immediately,
while the connect is still in progress by the operating system. If you
use -nonblock, you then can call ns_sockcheck with the write file id to
see if the connect was actually completed.

[para]
The -timeout option specifies how long to wait for the connect to be made in seconds before timing out.

# This is the NaviServer hosts.allow file. It allows you to specify which
# hosts may log in as certain users. If you have an entry in this
# file for a given user, you may not have an entry in hosts.deny for
# that same user.
#
# Example:
#
# nsadmin: ::1/64, 10.0.0.0/24, .internal.mycompany.com, home.me.com

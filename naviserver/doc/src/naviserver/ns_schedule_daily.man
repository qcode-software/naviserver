[titledesc {Schedule a script to run daily at a certain time}]

[description]

This command schedules a script to be run at a certain hour and minute of the day. 
Returns the ID of the newly scheduled script.  If -once is specified, then the script
is run once and then unscheduled, otherwise it will continue to run every day at that
time.  If -thread is specified, then the script will be run in its own thread, 
otherwise it will run in the scheduler's thread.  If the script is long-running,
this may interfere with the running of other scheduled scripts, so long-running scripts should
be run in their own threads.

NOTE: hour and minute are specified in local time.  Beware of Daylight Savings Time
shifts affecting the time of day when the script will execute.

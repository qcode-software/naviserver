[titledesc {Get the paths to a server's modules}]

[description]

This command returns the path to a server's directory and optionally to its modules. 
The command does no validation on the server to see if it is actually defined.

The server directory is a subdirectory of "servers" under the path returned from ns_info home.
 Modules are relative to that directory in the subdirectory "modules".

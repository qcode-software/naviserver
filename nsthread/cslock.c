/* 
 * cslock.c --
 *
 *	Support for critical sections.  Critical sections differ
 *	from mutexes in that a critical section can be repeatedly
 *	locked by the same thread as long as each lock is matched with
 * 	a cooresponding unlock.  Critical sections are used in cases
 *	where the lock could be called recursively, e.g., for the
 *	Ns_MasterLock.
 *
 *	Note:  Critical sections are almost always a bad idea.  You'll
 *	see below that the number of actual lock and unlock operations are
 *	doubled and threads can end up in condition waits instead of spin
 *	locks.

 * rwlock.c --
 *
 *	Routines for read/write locks.  Read/write locks differ from a mutex
 *	in that multiple threads can aquire the read lock until a single
 *	thread aquires a write lock.  This code is adapted from that in 
 *	Steven's Unix Network Programming, Volume 3. 
 *
 *	Note:  Read/write locks are not often a good idea.  The reason
 *	is, like critical sections, the number of actual lock operations
 *	is doubled which makes them more expensive to use.  Cases where the
 *	overhead are justified are then often subject to read locks being 
 *	held longer than writer threads can wait and/or writer threads holding
 *	the lock so long that many reader threads back up.  In these cases,
 *	specific reference counting techniques (e.g., the management of
 *	the Req structures in op.c) normally work better.
